Catalyzes three sequential oxidative reactions of 11-deoxycorticosterone (21-hydroxyprogesterone), namely 11-beta hydroxylation, followed by two successive oxidations at C18 yielding 18-hydroxy and then 18-oxo intermediates (that would not leave the enzyme active site during the consecutive hydroxylation reactions), ending with the formation of aldosterone.

Mechanistically, uses molecular oxygen inserting one oxygen atom into a substrate and reducing the second into a water molecule.

Catalyzes three sequential oxidative reactions of 11-deoxycorticosterone (21-hydroxyprogesterone), namely 11-beta hydroxylation, followed by two successive oxidations at C18 yielding 18-hydroxy and then 18-oxo intermediates (that do not leave the enzyme active site during the consecutive hydroxylation reactions), and end with the formation of aldosterone (PubMed:1765101, PubMed:2350348, PubMed:2738055, PubMed:8333830). Can also produce 18-hydroxycortisol and 18-oxocortisol, derived from successive oxidations of cortisol at C18, normally found at very low levels, but significantly increased in primary aldosteronism, the most common form of secondary hypertension (By similarity) (PubMed:1562515). Mechanistically, uses molecular oxygen inserting one oxygen atom into a substrate and reducing the second into a water molecule. Two electrons are provided by NADPH via a two-protein mitochondrial transfer system comprising flavoprotein FDXR (adrenodoxin/ferredoxin reductase) and nonheme iron-sulfur protein FDX1 or FDX2 (adrenodoxin/ferredoxin).

HAB is first hydroxylated at C5 to yield 3-hexaprenyl-4-amino-5-hydroxybenzoic acid (HHAB) which is further deaminated at C4 by COQ6 to produce DHHB (PubMed:26260787). {ECO:0000255|HAMAP-Rule:MF_03193, ECO:0000269|PubMed:21944752, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26260787}.","COFACTOR: Name=FAD; Xref=ChEBI:CHEBI:57692; Evidence={ECO:0000255|HAMAP-Rule:MF_03193, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26808124};",FAD;Flavoprotein;Hydrolase;Membrane;Mitochondrion;Mitochondrion inner membrane;Monooxygenase;Oxidoreductase;Reference proteome;Transit peptide;Ubiquinone biosynthesis,479,0.06680584551148225,0.006263048016701462,0.07515657620041753,0.03966597077244259,0.03549060542797495,0.05845511482254697,0.018789144050104383,0.060542797494780795,0.05636743215031315,0.11899791231732777,0.031315240083507306,0.05219206680584551,0.05845511482254697,0.016701461377870562,0.054279749478079335,0.07515657620041753,0.06680584551148225,0.05845511482254697,0.010438413361169102,0.03966597077244259,0.42171189979123175,0.2254697286012526,0.24425887265135698,0.2567849686847599,0.1419624217118998,53526.80790000005,0.08559498956158663,35.36620041753652,6.525025367736816,-0.18705636743215065,0.9986690729483284,0.31315240083507306,0.31941544885177453,0.3903966597077244

Catalyzes the reaction through a substrate-mediated reduction pathway, whereby NADH shuttles electrons to 5-methoxy-2-methyl-3-(all-trans-decaprenyl)benzoquinone, which then transfers the electrons to the two Fe(3+) centers. The binding of 5-methoxy-2-methyl-3-(all-trans-polyprenyl)benzoquinone (DMQn) mediates reduction of the diiron center by nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) and initiates oxygen activation for subsequent DMQ hydroxylation. The physiological substrates are 5-methoxy-2-methyl-3-(all-trans-nonaprenyl)benzoquinone (DMQ(9)) and 5-methoxy-2-methyl-3-(all-trans-decaprenyl)benzoquinone (DMQ(10)), however in vitro the enzyme does not have any specificity concerning the length of the polyprenyl tail, and accepts tails of various lengths with similar efficiency (By similarity).

Plays a key role in the metabolism of xenobiotics and drugs containing aromatic azaheterocyclic substituents. Participates in the bioactivation of prodrugs such as famciclovir, catalyzing the oxidation step from 6-deoxypenciclovir to penciclovir, which is a potent antiviral agent. Is probably involved in the regulation of reactive oxygen species homeostasis. May be a prominent source of superoxide generation via the one-electron reduction of molecular oxygen. May also catalyze nitric oxide (NO) production via the reduction of nitrite to NO with NADH or aldehyde as electron donor. May play a role in adipogenesis. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:20444863, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22031625, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22279051, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22522748, ECO:0000269|PubMed:22996261, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23857892, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26322824, ECO:0000269|PubMed:7786031, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9224775}.","COFACTOR: Name=[2Fe-2S] cluster; Xref=ChEBI:CHEBI:190135; Evidence={ECO:0000269|PubMed:22279051, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26322824, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26842593}; Note=Binds 2 [2Fe-2S] clusters per subunit. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:22279051, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26322824}; COFACTOR: Name=FAD; Xref=ChEBI:CHEBI:57692; Evidence={ECO:0000269|PubMed:22279051, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26322824}; Note=Binds 1 FAD per subunit. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:22279051, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26322824}; COFACTOR: Name=Mo-molybdopterin; Xref=ChEBI:CHEBI:71302; Evidence={ECO:0000269|PubMed:22279051, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26322824, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26842593}; Note=Binds 1 Mo-molybdopterin (Mo-MPT) cofactor per subunit. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:22279051, ECO:0000269|PubMed:26322824};",2Fe-2S;3D-structure;Cytoplasm;FAD;Flavoprotein;Iron;Iron-sulfur;Lipid metabolism;Metal-binding;Molybdenum;Oxidoreductase;Phosphoprotein;Proteomics identification;Reference proteome,1338,0.06950672645739911,0.03139013452914798,0.04110612855007474,0.06726457399103139,0.03886397608370702,0.08146487294469357,0.02914798206278027,0.06651718983557549,0.06203288490284006,0.09267563527653214,0.032137518684603884,0.04035874439461883,0.053064275037369206,0.03811659192825112,0.042600896860986545,0.06203288490284006,0.04783258594917788,0.06651718983557549,0.007473841554559043,0.029895366218236172,0.40358744394618834,0.21300448430493274,0.242152466367713,0.24962630792227206,0.19506726457399104,147916.33370000022,0.07623318385650224,43.263699551569744,6.791941261291503,-0.12272047832585974,0.9983156866960479,0.32361733931240655,0.27802690582959644,0.34977578475336324

Catalyzes the reaction through a substrate-mediated reduction pathway, whereby NADH shuttles electrons to 5-methoxy-2-methyl-3-(all-trans-decaprenyl)benzoquinone, which then transfers the electrons to the two Fe(3+) centers. The binding of 5-methoxy-2-methyl-3-(all-trans-polyprenyl)benzoquinone (DMQn) mediates reduction of the diiron center by nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) and initiates oxygen activation for subsequent DMQ hydroxylation. The physiological substrates are 5-methoxy-2-methyl-3-(all-trans-nonaprenyl)benzoquinone (DMQ(9)) and 5-methoxy-2-methyl-3-(all-trans-decaprenyl)benzoquinone (DMQ(10)), however in vitro the enzyme does not have any specificity concerning the length of the polyprenyl tail, and accepts tails of various lengths with similar efficiency (By similarity). Also has a structural role in the COQ enzyme complex, stabilizing other COQ polypeptides. Involved in lifespan determination in a ubiquinone-independent manner (By similarity).

Catalyzes the reaction through a substrate-mediated reduction pathway, whereby NADH shuttles electrons to 5-methoxy-2-methyl-3-(all-trans-decaprenyl)benzoquinone, which then transfers the electrons to the two Fe(3+) centers (PubMed:23445365). The binding of 5-methoxy-2-methyl-3-(all-trans-polyprenyl)benzoquinone (DMQn) mediates reduction of the diiron center by nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) and initiates oxygen activation for subsequent DMQ hydroxylation (PubMed:23445365). The physiological substrates are 5-methoxy-2-methyl-3-(all-trans-nonaprenyl)benzoquinone (DMQ(9)) and 5-methoxy-2-methyl-3-(all-trans-decaprenyl)benzoquinone (DMQ(10)), however in vitro the enzyme does not have any specificity concerning the length of the polyprenyl tail, and accepts tails of various lengths with similar efficiency (PubMed:23445365, PubMed:28409910). Also has a structural role in the COQ enzyme complex, stabilizing other COQ polypeptides. Involved in lifespan determination in a ubiquinone-independent manner (By similarity). Plays a role in modulating mitochondrial stress responses, acting in the nucleus, perhaps via regulating gene expression, independent of its characterized mitochondrial function in ubiquinone biosynthesis (PubMed:25961505). {ECO:0000255|HAMAP-Rule:MF_03194, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23445365, ECO:0000269|PubMed:25961505, ECO:0000269|PubMed:28409910, ECO:0000305|PubMed:23445365, ECO:0000305|PubMed:28409910, ECO:0000305|PubMed:38425362}.",COFACTOR: Name=Fe cation; Xref=ChEBI:CHEBI:24875; Evidence={ECO:0000269|PubMed:23445365}; Note=Binds 2 iron ions per subunit. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:23445365};,3D-structure;Alternative splicing;Chromosome;Disease variant;Iron;Membrane;Metal-binding;Mitochondrion;Mitochondrion inner membrane;Monooxygenase;Neurodegeneration;Neuropathy;Nucleus;Oxidoreductase;Primary mitochondrial disease;Proteomics identification;Reference proteome;Repeat;Transit peptide;Ubiquinone biosynthesis,217,0.11981566820276497,0.013824884792626729,0.04608294930875576,0.07373271889400922,0.02304147465437788,0.07373271889400922,0.03225806451612903,0.055299539170506916,0.041474654377880185,0.10599078341013825,0.03686635944700461,0.027649769585253458,0.03225806451612903,0.027649769585253458,0.09216589861751152,0.05069124423963134,0.03686635944700461,0.06451612903225806,0.013824884792626729,0.03225806451612903,0.45161290322580644,0.2534562211981567,0.2857142857142857,0.1889400921658986,0.15207373271889402,24276.735800000024,0.06912442396313365,50.93317972350231,8.774292182922363,-0.1870967741935485,0.9961924793956043,0.3778801843317972,0.2304147465437788,0.33179723502304154

Plays a role in the metabolism of xenobiotics and drugs containing aromatic azaheterocyclic substituents. Participates in the bioactivation of prodrugs such as famciclovir, catalyzing the oxidation step from 6-deoxypenciclovir to penciclovir, which is a potent antiviral agent. Is probably involved in the regulation of reactive oxygen species homeostasis. Is a prominent source of superoxide generation via the one-electron reduction of molecular oxygen. Also catalyzes nitric oxide (NO) production; under anaerobic conditions, reduces nitrite to NO with NADH or aldehyde as electron donor, but under aerobic conditions, NADH is the preferred substrate. These reactions may be catalyzed by several isozymes. May play a role in adipogenesis. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:17353002, ECO:0000269|PubMed:19801639, ECO:0000269|PubMed:23282065, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9224775, ECO:0000269|PubMed:9920943}.",COFACTOR: Name=[2Fe-2S] cluster; Xref=ChEBI:CHEBI:190135; Evidence={ECO:0000269|PubMed:17353002}; Note=Binds 2 [2Fe-2S] clusters per subunit. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:17353002}; COFACTOR: Name=FAD; Xref=ChEBI:CHEBI:57692; Evidence={ECO:0000269|PubMed:17353002}; Note=Binds 1 FAD per subunit. {ECO:0000269|PubMed:17353002}; COFACTOR: Name=Mo-molybdopterin; Xref=ChEBI:CHEBI:71302; Evidence={ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:O54754}; Note=Binds 1 Mo-molybdopterin (Mo-MPT) cofactor per subunit. {ECO:0000250|UniProtKB:O54754};,2Fe-2S;Cytoplasm;FAD;Flavoprotein;Iron;Iron-sulfur;Lipid metabolism;Metal-binding;Molybdenum;Oxidoreductase;Phosphoprotein;Reference proteome,1333,0.06451612903225806,0.03075768942235559,0.04426106526631658,0.06601650412603151,0.035258814703675916,0.08627156789197299,0.030007501875468866,0.06151537884471118,0.05476369092273068,0.0900225056264066,0.0277569392348087,0.0345086271567892,0.05251312828207052,0.03900975243810953,0.04876219054763691,0.06676669167291822,0.05926481620405101,0.07051762940735183,0.009752438109527382,0.0277569392348087,0.3870967741935484,0.21380345086271568,0.24381095273818454,0.25806451612903225,0.19954988747186797,146919.17880000029,0.072768192048012,43.38300075018778,6.545487403869629,-0.1710427606901727,0.9985699719464827,0.30307576894223553,0.28432108027006747,0.35408852213053266

In the presence of TAA, functions as a desaturase, enabling the degradation of TAA and resulting in the formation of the hemiterpene 3-hydroxy-3-methylbut-1-ene. The specificity of the catalysis depends strongly on the molecule structure of the substrate, allowing either hydroxylation or desaturation reactions (PubMed:22194447).

Catalyzes the reaction through a substrate-mediated reduction pathway, whereby NADH shuttles electrons to 5-methoxy-2-methyl-3-(all-trans-decaprenyl)benzoquinone, which then transfers the electrons to the two Fe(3+) centers. The binding of 5-methoxy-2-methyl-3-(all-trans-polyprenyl)benzoquinone (DMQn) mediates reduction of the diiron center by nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) and initiates oxygen activation for subsequent DMQ hydroxylation. The physiological substrates are 5-methoxy-2-methyl-3-(all-trans-nonaprenyl)benzoquinone (DMQ(9)) and 5-methoxy-2-methyl-3-(all-trans-decaprenyl)benzoquinone (DMQ(10)), however in vitro the enzyme does not have any specificity concerning the length of the polyprenyl tail, and accepts tails of various lengths with similar efficiency (By similarity). Also has a structural role in the COQ enzyme complex, stabilizing other COQ polypeptides. Involved in lifespan determination in a ubiquinone-independent manner (By similarity).
